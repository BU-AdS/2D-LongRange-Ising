# BU-AdS 2D-AdS production code base                    30th November 2017

This library is a C++ implementation of a 2D phi^4 theory on AdS_2. It has
the following functionalities for the Laplace operator:

    1. Lattice action
    2. CG inverter (propagator)
    3. Eigensolver
    4. Various hypergeometric utilities

Stay tuned for the addition of a cluster algorithm for simulations.
